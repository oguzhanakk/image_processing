# image_processing
There are 4 projects in this Repository.
These are the projects I made using the numpy and OpenCV image processing libraries, which are also in Python in my projects.

The first project allows us to detect the face of the pictures we put and show them as a square frame.

The second project, on the other hand, provides 2 different impressions of the same work as Face and Eye.

The third project shows the faces in the image displayed on the Webcam by detecting and framing them.

The fourth project was to do the same job as face and eyes.
